![Polaris Catalog Header](docs/img/logos/Polaris-Catalog-BLOG-symmetrical-subhead.png)

Polaris is an open-source, fully-featured catalog for Apache Iceberg‚Ñ¢. It implements Iceberg's 
[REST API](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml),
enabling seamless multi-engine interoperability across a wide range of platforms, including Apache Doris‚Ñ¢, Apache Flink¬Æ,
Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, StarRocks, and Trino.

Documentation is available at https://polaris.io, including
[Polaris management API doc](https://polaris.io/index.html#tag/polaris-management-service_other)
and [Apache Iceberg REST API doc](https://polaris.io/index.html#tag/Configuration-API).


## Status
Polaris Catalog is open source under an Apache 2.0 license.

## Building and Running 

Polaris is organized into the following modules:
- `polaris-core` - The main Polaris entity definitions and core business logic
- `polaris-server` - The Polaris REST API server
- `polaris-eclipselink` - The Eclipselink implementation of the MetaStoreManager interface
 
Polaris is built using Gradle with Java 21+ and Docker 27+.
- `./gradlew build` - To build and run tests. Make sure Docker is running, as the integration tests depend on it.
- `./gradlew assemble` - To skip tests.
- `./gradlew test` - To run unit tests and integration tests.
- `./gradlew runApp` - To run the Polaris server locally on localhost:8181. 
  - The server starts with the in-memory mode, and it prints the auto-generated credentials to STDOUT in a message like this `realm: default-realm root principal credentials: <id>:<secret>`
  - These credentials can be used as "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in OAuth2 requests (e.g. the `curl` command below).
- `./regtests/run.sh` - To run regression tests or end-to-end tests in another terminal.

Running in Docker
- `docker build -t localhost:5001/polaris:latest .` - To build the image.
- `docker run -p 8181:8181 localhost:5001/polaris:latest` - To run the image in standalone mode.
- `docker compose up --build --exit-code-from regtest` - To run regression tests in a Docker environment.

Running in Kubernetes
- `./setup.sh` - To run Polaris as a mini-deployment locally. This will create one pod that bind itself to ports `8181` and `8182`.
- `kubectl port-forward svc/polaris-service -n polaris 8181:8181 8182:8182` - To create secure connections between a local machine and a pod within the cluster for both service and metrics endpoints.
  - Currrently supported metrics endpoints:
    - localhost:8182/metrics
    - localhost:8182/healthcheck
- `kubectl get pods -n polaris` - To check the status of the pods.
- `kubectl get deployment -n polaris` - To check the status of the deployment.
- `kubectl describe deployment polaris-deployment -n polaris` - To troubleshoot if things aren't working as expected.

Building docs
- Docs are generated using [Redocly](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/installation). To regenerate them, run the following
commands from the project root directory.
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/spec docker.io/redocly/cli join spec/docs.yaml spec/polaris-management-service.yml spec/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml -o spec/index.yaml --prefix-components-with-info-prop title
docker run -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/spec docker.io/redocly/cli build-docs spec/index.yaml --output=docs/index.html --config=spec/redocly.yaml
```

## Connecting from an Engine
To connect from an engine like Spark, first create a catalog with these steps:
```bash
# Generate a token for the root principal, replacing <CLIENT_ID> and <CLIENT_SECRET> with
# the values from the Polaris server output.
export PRINCIPAL_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8181/api/catalog/v1/oauth/tokens \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>&scope=PRINCIPAL_ROLE:ALL' \
   | jq -r '.access_token')
   
# Create a catalog named `polaris`
curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRINCIPAL_TOKEN" -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8181/api/management/v1/catalogs \
  -d '{"name": "polaris", "id": 100, "type": "INTERNAL", "readOnly": false, "storageConfigInfo": {"storageType": "FILE"}, "properties": {"default-base-location": "file:///tmp/polaris"}}'
```

From here, you can use Spark to create namespaces, tables, etc. More details can be found in the
[Quick Start Guide](https://polaris.io/#section/Quick-Start/Using-Iceberg-and-Polaris).
